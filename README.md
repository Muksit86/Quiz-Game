# Quiz-Game

“Quiz Game” is a game or application that provides us with various general quiz questions and answers in a fun and interactive way.
We built this project using the programming language Python. Python is a very popular and simple programming language. 
As the years pass by more and more content is added to the books. But most times students find it very difficult to understand each topic and it is hard to remember small details and topics. It is important to have an interactive and fun way of learning something, so that’s why our project is so important.
First, we did a little research that what could be the most fun way of learning something. Then we found quiz games. So, then we implemented our quiz application using the Python programming language.
And at the end, we finally got a game that included multiple questions and some options. Play the game go through a question and try to find the answers.
The meaning of making this project is to ensure that students don’t get demotivated and hopeless as if they can’t remember some topic or detail.
